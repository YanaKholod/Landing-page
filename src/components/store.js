    description: `This course will enable you to surprise your students not just by what you teach but by how you teach. The course is based on the three pillars of mindfulness teaching and can be applied within any mindfulness programme including MBSR, MBCT and other approaches.
     It will show you how to keep teaching Simple - you will be shown that keeping teaching simple is not only more effective for your students/clients but also takes the pressure of yourself as a teacher also. You will explore how to keep teaching in the here and now and not to get lost in over explanation.
     You will explore how to make teaching Elegant - Elegance is what you leave out. Many teachers say far too much and over complicate this simple and profound practice. You will be shown that what you leave out, is as important as what you put in. It will show you why you should avoid cramming too much information and too many activities into your classes, and allow space.
     Ensure teaching is Practical - Teaching has to be practical and relevant to a student’s or client’s everyday life. You will explore how to show your students/clients how to apply mindfulness to every area of their lives, such as home, work and relationships. Relationships are often an area of much difficulty but also of much growth. You will learn practical techniques to share with your students when in difficult situations in life.
